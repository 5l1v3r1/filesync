FileSync README
---------------

FileSync's main purpose is to synchronize two directories with each other.
However it's quite flexible, for example its simulation mode could be used
to make a CRC comparison of 2 directories, without actually overwriting
anything.

there are several rules which decide what has to copied
- existance
- filesize
- older modification time
- newer modification time
- different CRC

Additionally it has an operation mode that takes a 3rd directory parameter
which is used to store the differences. if this parameter is not used,
filesync will just use the destination directory instead.
this mode can be used to create incremental backups, or e.g. to 
create an archive of changed files as a patch. using unionfs-fuse or aufs
leads to even more interesting usecases...

please simply run the filesync command without arguments to see the full
list of possible switches and features, and to learn about its usage.
